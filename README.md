### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I made this GitHub profile just to have my repositories available online. The repos are mainly meant for self-learning purposes, so most of them are probably of no use to you ðŸ™‚

Current goals for my repos is to have some preconfigured libraries/Gradle plugins and use them in a "starter" Spring Boot project. Then use that project as a base for new Spring Boot applications.

Other goals are to have some example application running in cloud with most of the infrastructure setup here as GitOps. Lastly I would like to learn Rust ðŸ¦€

That's it for now, don't expect any regular updates or consistency in what I do here, it's all just for me ðŸ™‚
